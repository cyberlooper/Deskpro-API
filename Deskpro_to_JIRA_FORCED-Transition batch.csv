The disclosure details a new persistence technique used by an attacker, in conjunction with known vulnerabilities, to maintain read-only access to FortiGate devices through the use of symbolic links even after the initial access vector has been remediated. SSL-VPN vulnerabilities often targeted by attackersVPN appliances are often internet-facing by design and frequent targets for exploitation by cyber threat groups. Fortinet's disclosure highlights ongoing interest in VPN appliances from attackers and the innovative methods used to maintain access once compromised.The NHS England National CSOC strongly encourages organisations to review their external-facing assets and to ensure these are regularly patched and securely configured.  Post-exploitation activity detailsFortinet has stated that an attacker used a known vulnerability to compromise a FortiGate device and implement read-only access to the file system using a symbolic link between the user and root filesystems. If the vulnerable device was updated to remediate the original vulnerability, the symbolic link may not have been removed which could allow the attacker continued read-only access to the filesystem, including configuration files.  Affected platforms:Fortinet FortiOS Fortinet FortiGate Affected organisations are encouraged to review Fortinet's Analysis of Threat Actor Activity blog post and complete any applicable mitigation actions.  Upgrade all devices to FortiOS version 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 &amp; 7.0.17 or 6.4.16. Review the configuration of all devices. Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps to recover   Cyber Associates Network TI SpaceNHS England has a dedicated ‘Threat Intelligence’ (TI) space on the FutureNHS Cyber Associates Network. To get access to the Cyber Associates Network: https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-and-data-security/about-us/cyber-associates-network Suppliers may also be endorsed to exclusively access the TI space by emailing: cybersecurity@nhs.net After an account has been created with FutureNHS, Cyber Associates Network should be selected on the ‘My Workspaces’ menu item.

I would remove the 156-2274 but none of the numbers on the excel sheet match the numbers the main porters use so may be a mix up and another department use those bleeps. There a few separate portering departments: main porters (us), X ray porters, day surgery porters, theatre porters and environmental service porters (waste team tug drivers). As far as i am aware the main porters are the only ones that carry and respond to emergency bleeps.  Bleeps currently in use: SFM 156-0697, Porter supervisor 156-0792, ED team leader 156-0911, ED porter 156-0904, Porters desk controller 156-2300, Rosie porter 156-0982.Main porters: 156-0706, 156-0906, 156-0008, 156-0009 &amp; 156-10904. We have 2 more that I found in a draw which I believe to be back ups. One is the one you are looking for 156-2027 and the other is a duplicate 156-0906. Hope this helps and if any more show up I'll let you know. Many ThanksAlanFrom: HOUCHIN, Victoria (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;victoria.houchin1@nhs.net&gt;Sent: 10 April 2025 12:51To: SHD-ESTATES-SUPERVISOR-PORTERING-TEAM (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;cuh.estatessupervisorporteringteam@nhs.net&gt;Cc: SHD-UC-ADMIN (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;cuh.ucadmin@nhs.net&gt;; CORT-MONK, Jacqueline (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;j.cort-monk@nhs.net&gt;Subject: Cardiac Arrest Bleep Responses Good afternoon, Please can you reiterate to all the bleep holders in your team, the need to now respond daily to cardiac arrest bleep test calls. Looking at specific bleeps: 156-2274 – Portering assistant Mark Bennett – I popped in to the office and spoke about this and it was stated this member of staff no longer worked here and the bleep was likely lost.

We manage the Trust's mobile phone contract.According to our records, you are holding a Samsung Galaxy A3, mobile number 07514638912. This device is out of date and requires an upgrade. To process your upgrade we will require your current handset to be returned to the Contact Centre (ATC Level 1) to be exchanged. We are available Monday-Friday between 08:30-16:30, please confirm your availability so we can arrange a suitable timeslot for you. Where we are able to, we will also transfer the data (contacts, photos, apps etc.) from your current phone to the new phone, however some out of date handsets do not allow for this so it may not be possible.

May I ask if this happens with internal calls as well as external ones?  I realise this may be difficult to remember. We are aware of ongoing call quality issues and dropouts at the moment, which we are investigating more thoroughly.  There is going to be some detailed system monitoring happening later this week, and a web form emailed to all those we think may be affected so that you can record the time and nature of your issues, which will help with out investigation. If your internal calls are also inconsistent though you may be having a different issue, in which case I or one of my colleagues will come and visit your office.

You can also set a call forward so that it goes to voicemail immediately by pressing the button on the top right of the screen, and you can set a destination of 216100 (voicemail) by pressing the right directional button and inputting the number.To mute the ringer, you just hold the Asterix* key, which also has a little bell icon. Here is a basic function guide. QRC.bookHopefully this will solve your call quality issues. Please make sure to use the phone in earnest and report back if you are having any issues.

We manage the Trust's mobile phone contract.According to our records, you are holding a Samsung Galaxy A51, mobile number 07598404045. This device is out of date and requires an upgrade. To process your upgrade we will require your current handset to be returned to the Contact Centre (ATC Level 1) to be exchanged. We are available Monday-Friday between 08:30-16:30, please confirm your availability so we can arrange a suitable timeslot for you. Where we are able to, we will also transfer the data (contacts, photos, apps etc.) from your current phone to the new phone, however some out of date handsets do not allow for this so it may not be possible.

Currently it only goes to the active server (10.229.128.75. AVCLIBDB01 I believe)  which then replicates onto the remaining servers. Which server would be the preferred to upload to? Once I know this I should be able to get this done immediately (hopefully today).David, in regard to the recordings I have made this folder: \\10.229.128.186\Liberty2_recordingsThe user account to connect to it is 10.229.128.186\libbackup password will be in the configuration of the old servers we believe this will be our B&amp;it1250?

I'm sure you've got a mountain of work to get through so sorry to add to your load but I've been instructed by OP senior management that we MUST have 1 contact number for both Pathology and Outpatients so that all agents are logged into the same contact centre to take both Pathology and Outpatient calls simultaneously (except for call handlers who only take OP calls).  Please can you advise what the best and quickest way would be to set this up in Liberty as this will have an impact on updating all communications with a different number.  Would it be possible to redirect both the Pathology and OP contact numbers into a centralised contact centre within Liberty?Need to redesign and plan the new IVR and see what is and isnt possible."^"From: 17421 - 05/19/2025 10:37:29 : cuhservicedesk@telefonicatech.ukGood morning Team, I’m hoping you may be able to help. We have an ongoing project to upgrade our phone system called Liberty. The current system has a DNS setup (Liberty/) which routes to either of our server IP's. As part of the project we will need to update our Liberty DNS to the new system IP's once we are at a point to migrate over to our new servers. Its critical we line up our migration with the change to ensure no impact to our service users.  Is there a process I should follow to arrange this change when the time comes?  Kind Regards, Morena Turnbull Morena Turnbull | Infrastructure Manager | Unified Communications | Capital, Estates and Facilities ManagementTel: 01223 216170 option 2Monday to Friday, 08:30 – 17:20cuh.ucservicedesk@nhs.net | www.cuh.org.ukUnified Communications | Capital, Estates and Facilities Management | Box 144Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's HospitalCambridge Biomedical Campus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQThe Trust is: part of the National Institute for Health Research - Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre | and a member of Cambridge University Health Partners "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would prefer not to transfer data from your current handset, we can provide your new phone 'out of the box', which takes approximately 20 minutes.

We manage the Trust's mobile phone contract.According to our records, you are holding a Samsung Galaxy A50, mobile number 07707650113. This device is out of date and requires an upgrade. To process your upgrade we will require your current handset to be returned to the Contact Centre (ATC Level 1) to be exchanged. We are available Monday-Friday between 08:30-16:30, please confirm your availability so we can arrange a suitable timeslot for you. Where we are able to, we will also transfer the data (contacts, photos, apps etc.) from your current phone to the new phone, however some out of date handsets do not allow for this so it may not be possible. To transfer data to your new phone we will require your handset to be left with us for approximately two hours, although time will vary dependant on the size of the data being transferred. If you would prefer not to transfer data from your current handset, we can provide your new phone 'out of the box', which takes approximately 20 minutes. Your mobile number will remain the same.                                                                                   If you are no longer holding 07707650113, or it is no longer required, please confirm as soon as possible.Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions.Kind regards, Joey Joey Perez | Administrator / Procurement Support Officer,Unified Communications Administration Team Tel: 01223 216170 option 1 | www.cuh.nhs.ukCapital, Estates &amp; Facilities Management | Box 144Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's HospitalCambridge Biomedical Campus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQ The Trust is: part of the National Institute for Health Research - Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and a member of Cambridge University Health Partners This email is confidential, see www.cuh.nhs.uk/email_disclaimer.html "^"From: 18558 - 04/30/2025 09:14:58 : password: claydone"^"From: 18558 - 05/01/2025 13:37:50 : From: SHD-UC-ADMIN (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;cuh.ucadmin@nhs.net&gt; Sent: 01 May 2025 13:37To: CLAYDON SOARES, Elaine (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;elaine.claydonsoares@nhs.net&gt;Subject: RE: Trust Mobile 07707650113 - Ready Hi Elaine, Thank you.

However, Jackie mentioned this may be of benefit to you for overview? For our documentation please could you let us know in what capacity having the overview would help? I presume this would be an ‘awareness only’ bleep and therefore anyone holding this bleep would know not to respond to calls?

I believe I can remove them from other groups : Trauma – Adult, Paeds and Obstetric.  Brief explanation of why this pager is needed and the impact if this request was rejected:This emergency pager will enable a prompt response to emergencies at CUH for the provision of support by the Chaplaincy Team following a cardiac arrest/medical emergency/trauma.Research shows that early intervention and engagement is essential for reducing the incidence of trauma/stress/anxiety in staff members following a significant event. Anecdotally this is also evident from the experience of our Chaplains who find that staff respond better and recover sooner when interventions can occur soon after an event.This engagement will form part of a larger project to support staff and carrying the pager is the easiest way of ensuring a notification is passed to the Chaplains.   Kind regards, Joey Joey Perez | Administrator / Procurement Support Officer,Unified Communications Administration Team Tel: 01223 216170 option 1 | www.cuh.nhs.ukCapital, Estates &amp; Facilities Management | Box 144Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's HospitalCambridge Biomedical Campus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQ The Trust is: part of the National Institute for Health Research - Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and a member of Cambridge University Health Partners This email is confidential, see www.cuh.nhs.uk/email_disclaimer.html   From: HOUCHIN, Victoria (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;victoria.houchin1@nhs.net&gt; Sent: 29 April 2025 14:07To: SHD-UC-ADMIN (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;cuh.ucadmin@nhs.net&gt;Cc: CORT-MONK, Jacqueline (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;j.cort-monk@nhs.net&gt;Subject: Removal of bleep 156 - 2135 Good afternoon, Please could I request that bleep 156 – 2135 is removed from the cardiac test group and we will return this bleep to you.

For example, a voicemail  would be made at midday but we would not receive the email until the following morning. &nbsp; Voice services looked into this and determined that it was an IT system issue, rather than an issue their team could sort. &nbsp; Today we have come in to 10 emails that have been delivered to us overnight, most of which were made Monday morning. On double checking this, I noticed two we received yesterday were also sent on Monday, which means we’ve received 12 calls  with long delays. &nbsp; Because of this delay, one woman who is pregnant and having a flare has spent the last 48 hours not hearing back from us and struggling without any help. She called around 9am on Monday and we could have booked her in for a same day appointment.  A lot of the calls we’ve received are pretty urgent and would’ve really needed advice given on Monday, but are now having to wait some days, which can be quite dangerous. &nbsp; I’ve attached a word document with screenshots of each call, so you can see what time we received it in our mailbox, what time it was actually sent, and the contact number. Our Advice Line contact number is 01223 257212 and the email address  is cuh.ibdadviceline@nhs.net &nbsp; Please can someone look into this as a matter of urgency? &nbsp; Best Wishes, &nbsp; Scarlett &nbsp; Scarlett Diver- IBD Administrator Tel: (01223) 217990 NHS.net email: scarlett.diver@nhs.net  Gastroenterology Department, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge.  &nbsp; &nbsp;    ************************************************************************************** ******************************  This message may contain confidential information.

We are aware of an ongoing national NHS digital Microsoft 365 incident which started 29/04 09:30. This will have affected any services sending send emails via NHS.net. Comm’s has gone out today in the CUH daily advising of the current issue and mitigation available, along with the links to NHS digital incident.I’ve looked into the examples provided and from our voicemail system the emails were sent within 2 minutes of being received. Unfortunately the issues with email delays appear to originate from NHS.net which is part of the Microsoft 365 platform managed nationally by NHS Digital. Due to voicemails potentially containing personal information we are required by NHS England and Information Governance’s policies to send emails via NHS.net.To mitigate against NHS.net email delays we would suggest dialing into our voicemail system to listen to voicemails. This can be done by calling 01223 216100 and logging in with the voicemail number and pin. If you need assistance with login credentials please email cuh.ucservicedesk@nhs.netKing RegardsJonathan WoodsUnified Communications"^"From: 19191 - 04/30/2025 15:58:06 :  Dear Jonathan, &nbsp; Thank you for your email. &nbsp; Unfortunately using our phone to access the voicemail system isn’t practical. Our office phone is a GP line which is open for GPs to call us with  any issues, as well as any urgent internal calls. Additionally, with the high volume of calls we receive every day, it’s not really feasible. &nbsp; Best Wishes, &nbsp; Scarlett &nbsp; Scarlett Diver- IBD Administrator Tel: (01223) 217990 NHS.net email: scarlett.diver@nhs.net  Gastroenterology Department, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     &nbsp;       ************************************************************************************** ******************************  This message may contain confidential information.

I have checked 596095 and can’t see a voicemail attached to this number. We have had other reports of similar issues from other teams and, upon looking into them have found that the voicemail system is working fine and that there is an issue with the email system. Unfortunately, once the email leaves our system we have no further control. Any delays from there would be in either the NHS.net email exchange or a local PC issue. Our advice would be to contact IT and report the email issue delay stating Voice Services have confirmed there’s no delays for emails within the voicemail system.

The virtual fracture clinic is a virtual clinic that currently runs 3-4 times per week. Recently there has been an increased demand  on the service which means the telephone calls made to every patient (up to 60 patients per clinic) as well as the other administrative tasks associated with the clinic are being facilitated by 3 members of staff rather than just 2. Currently the office only  has two phone lines which at times has caused delays and a reduction in the efficiency of the service. Having 3 phone lines would mean that all members of staff could call the patients at the same time which would reduce the length of time patients are having  the wait for their phone call and increase the efficiency of the service. The demand on the service is only expected to increase meaning an additional phone is vital in the delivery of this service.   2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Description of what mitigating actions have been considered in such circumstances? or, what alternatives  have been considered? No other phone are available for use within clinic&nbsp; 1 and there is not a mobile phone available to make  these calls. As the clinic is a virtual clinic, the process is that each patient receives a phone call from a specialist nurse so in order for this to be facilitated another phone line or mobile phone is required. There are no feasible alternatives.   &nbsp;  Information for the engineers:   Name of the main contact: Samantha Wright  Main contact number: 01223348299 Preferred date and time if approved:  Next available Thursday (anytime) if possible (e.g. asap, please be aware there is a 5 day SLA once we have reviewed and approved the request) HR number of where the lines is being requested:16-02-011 Any available sockets that can be used (please provide the numbers): 1 phone line socket&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thank you  for considering our request.

The issue you would have is that different sites will use different telephone technologies, some may use Voice over IP (VOIP) and others analogue phones or even digital direct exchange lines, we use a mix of the three even just within Addenbrookes.I would have thought most phones in use out in the field have a speakerphone function just based on the ones we use in the trust, but of course you will have far more experience of what goes on in other trusts/GPs than me!

However, with the recent reduction in our administration team, we are reviewing our internal processes to improve efficiency and reduce the time taken to manage and review training records. To support this, we’d like to explore the possibility of holding all training information directly within MRI, ideally under the ‘Skills’ section of each resource profile. We’re happy to upload the data ourselves, but we’d need the ability to monitor and report on it effectively. Specifically, we’re looking for a dashboard that allows us to: Clearly see whose training has expired or is due to expire Search by training course Search by individual View by team or group Additionally, it would be extremely helpful to have an SSRS report that presents this information in a format similar to the attached example. Please could you let me know what is possible? Kind Regards Dwayne Dwayne Wright | CAFM Development and Systems Manager | Estates &amp; FacilitiesDirect Dial: 01223 254542Building, Engineering and Maintenance | Level 1Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's HospitalHills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQ | Box 102This email is confidential, see www.cuh.org.uk/email_disclaimer.html "^"From: 16244 - 05/02/2025 08:15:33 : Hi Dwayne,Good morning!

Please do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content  is safe.        ​       &nbsp;&nbsp;Unified Communications Infrastructure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57684 - Ticket Updated      Dear Kay,   Please see update below regarding your live request with us - reference 57684 for New provision of telephone line for a consultant     Hi Pooja,   Apologies for the delay with this, I have been on leave.   I ran a report checking the number of calls on the two phones in your office (349442 &amp; 274855) Over the previous 7 days.   This report shows that 349442 made 0 calls and 274855 made 2 calls.   Given these extremely low call volumes our infrastructure manager would not be able to approve the provision of a new telephone line for you.   If you don’t want to share a physical handset we can double one of your existing lines, meaning each user will have their own physical handset but 2 of them will share 1 phone line. Given the low number of calls I don’t anticipate this causing too many  problems.   Please let me know your thoughts on the above and how you would like to proceed.    Kind Regards, Zac    If our update requires a response please reply to  cuh.ucservicedesk@nhs.net or call extension 216170 (option 2).

The voicemail services checks if there is an account associated with 586781 and there isn’t so reads ‘this user does not have voicemail’.There is a workaround but it is not a suitable long term solution, so how long are you expecting this to be in place for? If it is a long term thing we will need to look into having an additional mailbox set up on 586781.Kind Regards,Zac"^"From: 21669 - 05/07/2025 13:14:10 : Hi Zac, Thank you for this information. I think this phone redirection will be in place for the foreseeable future. If another mailbox is required, the voicemail emails need to be sent to: cuh.outpatientphysio@nhs.net Many thanks,Edward Betts | Clinic Co-ordinator - Physiotherapy|Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust |Addenbrookes Hospital | Box 185 | Cambridge BiomedicalCampus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQTel: 01223 250828The Trust is: part of the National Institute for Health Research - Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and a member of Cambridge University Health Partners.

This means that the call flow ill work like this User calls 586781Diverted to 216633Diverted to Voicemail of 216633 if unanswered I have tested the above and it is working as expected.The reason we don’t recommend the workaround usually is that if you now requested a separate voicemail on 586781 it wouldn’t work, but we can undo what we have done here if that comes up in the future.

The phone did not ring and although Liberty showed the number of calls they did not come through.&nbsp;     Since contacting you I switched off my phone completely, as I had done before, and this time I was able to be connected as usual.

Please find attached email confirmation from MEL manager. In the CAB meeting it was explained that the way the system was set up with the MEL was that for every item that can be delivered (mark with D), there should be a retrieve entry (marked with R). The idea behind this, when the Portal was set up if an item was delivered (chair mat), but when it arrived it was no longer required it can be booked in to be returned.MEL has raised concerns regarding the ward returning unpacked falls mats (chair/bed). To address this, we would like to discontinue the practice of returning these mats to MEL. As a team, we recommend not including the option of returning these items (bed /chair mats) moving forward. To meet formatting guidelines each entry needs to contain the full name of the item for each listing for consistency, while staying under the character limit. This would make the amended list as follows:1.             Falls Alarm Monitor Only (D)Falls Alarm Monitor Only (R)Falls Alarm Bed Mat Only (D)Falls Alarm Bed Mat Only (R)Falls Alarm Chair Mat Only (D)Falls Alarm Chair Mat Only (R)Falls Alarm Complete Set (D)Falls Alarm Complete Set (R) Would it be possible for us to proceed with the following, please, as it is clearer and more specific?For example, the term 'Falls Alarm bed mat' could lead to confusion among staff, as they may assume they are receiving both the falls alarm and the bed mat.Following discussion with the Falls Prevention Lead and the Lead Nurse for Harm-Free Care, we would like to proceed with the following options, please. Falls Alarm Monitor Only (D)Falls Alarm Monitor Only (R)Falls Bed Mat Only (D)Falls Chair Mat Only (D)Falls Alarm set - Monitor, Bed and Chair Mat (D)  (if there is any character restriction, we can stick to 'Falls Alarm complete set') Feel free to contact if any queries. Kind regards,Sneha Sneha Elsa JohnsonFalls Prevention Practitioner From: GAWTHROP-BLEET, Christopher (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;christopher.gawthrop-bleet@nhs.net&gt;Sent: 15 May 2025 09:41To: JOHNSON, Sneha (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;sneha.johnson3@nhs.net&gt;Subject: Re: Request for change : Falls Alarm ordering system Hi Sneha, I have feedback from the CAB meeting and want to give you an update.

We manage the Trust's mobile phone contract.According to our records, you are holding a Samsung Galaxy A51, mobile number 07926071467. This device is out of date and is like to get affected by the 3G switch off happening this year thus an upgrade is required. To process your upgrade we will require your current handset to be returned to the Contact Centre (ATC Level 1) to be exchanged. We are available Monday-Friday between 08:30-16:30, please confirm your availability so we can arrange a suitable timeslot for you. When we are able to, we will also transfer the data (contacts, photos, apps etc.) from your current phone to the new phone, however some out of date handsets do not allow for this so it may not be possible. To transfer data to your new phone we will require your handset to be left with us for approximately two hours, although time will vary dependant on the size of the data being transferred. If you would prefer not to transfer data from your current handset, we can provide your new phone 'out of the box', which takes approximately 20 minutes. Your mobile number will remain the same.                                              If you are no longer holding 07926071467, or it is no longer required, please confirm as soon as possible. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions. Thank you  Kind regards, Joey Joey Perez | Administrator / Procurement Support Officer,Unified Communications Administration Team Tel: 01223 216170 option 1 | www.cuh.nhs.ukCapital, Estates &amp; Facilities Management | Box 144Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's HospitalCambridge Biomedical Campus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQ The Trust is: part of the National Institute for Health Research - Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and a member of Cambridge University Health Partners This email is confidential, see www.cuh.nhs.uk/email_disclaimer.html "^"From: 18558 - 05/12/2025 08:19:08 :   From: HARRIS, Daniel (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;daniel.harris30@nhs.net&gt; Sent: 12 May 2025 08:10To: SHD-UC-ADMIN (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;cuh.ucadmin@nhs.net&gt;Subject: RE: Trust Mobile 07926071467 I can come down at 9.00. Transferring the number and data would be great if possible. Thanks so much, Dan Harris (he/him) | Adult Critical Care Matron Phone: 01223 256088 or 07926071467 | EPIC Secure Chat: Daniel Harris| www.cuh.nhs.ukBook time to meet with me This email is confidential, see www.cuh.nhs.uk/email_disclaimer.html From: SHD-UC-ADMIN (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;cuh.ucadmin@nhs.net&gt; Sent: 12 May 2025 08:08To: HARRIS, Daniel (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;daniel.harris30@nhs.net&gt;Subject: RE: Trust Mobile 07926071467 Hi Daniel, Thank you for your response We have availability today anytime from 09-12. Please can you choose what would you like to do during the upgrade? Transfer the contacts to the new phone only – this takes between 15-30 minutes. Transfer the number and data from the old phone – we require approximately 2 hours or more depending on the size of data to get transferred.

After this 4-week period,  we will still be limited in what posts we can recruit to in future.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   To date, we have had a 1 out, 1 in policy whereas now we are heading towards a 1 out, NO in policy UNLESS we can comprehensively demonstrate the critical worth of that role.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   This means the team annual reports I was planning on having completed by appraisal season, now need to be fast forwarded so we have some urgent oversight of your roles and their impact.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Rather than pulling together a whole report, please can you use the attached template and return to me by end of next week (Friday 7th March), only populating the sections required for the below information. Please liaise with your line manager in the first instance for support in completing.&nbsp;  You can then finish the rest of the report in the background with a bit more time:&nbsp;   &nbsp;     What service(s) do you cover - i.e. which oncology specialty; inpatients and/or outpatients?&nbsp;     Who is who in your team / WTE and banding - also which consultants support your service?&nbsp;     What clinics do your CNSs run, and WHO runs them - eg B6 / B7 or 8a clinics.      I do NOT need patient numbers; I can pull this information as am working on this already but having your clinic codes will help me triangulate this data.&nbsp;      Any admission avoidance work you do and if possible, any accompanying data - e.g. number of incoming / outgoing phone calls (voice services can pull this data for you - contactable via email) or numbers of MyChart  messages.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Please can I reassure you that your own jobs are NOT under threat, but any&nbsp;upcoming vacancies may become threatened, hence we need as much detail as possible for us to be able to  try to protect these roles going forwards.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Many thanks for your help as we navigate this together.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Kindest regards,&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Ingela Oberg   &nbsp;   CUH Lead Cancer&nbsp;Nurse&nbsp;  Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's Hospital | Division B Cambridge Biomedical Campus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQ email: i.oberg@nhs.net &nbsp; PA:&nbsp; Nasiphi Unwin Email:&nbsp; &nbsp;nasiphi.unwin1@nhs.net Or via Teams &nbsp;  &nbsp;     ************************************************************************************** ******************************  This message may contain confidential information.

If you want to do this manually this should give you a much more accurate number in the ‘Raw Data’ table but this would be very time consuming.Due to this, I have created a table with the estimated numbers. To do this I have removed 25% of entries as this is roughly the number of duplicate entries on an average call report. This should give you an indication of what you are looking for, but please do bare in mind this really is a best effort estimate.Kind regards,Damian"^"From: 19584 - 05/13/2025 16:11:20 :  Dear Damian Could you provide us with the time-frame for this call record please?

PC and laptop readiness or provision would need to be through Paul Froud and AV through Simon Fishpool (media studio). I’ve looped in Mandie in the first instance so that my team can have an initial look – we would want to check 4g coverage and also consider other telephony options such as ONS which they can explain. We might also want to consider one of the Trust’s free phone numbers being part of the provision as needed. There’ll also need to be some process to support the requirement along with periodic dry runs both of which I’m sure you’ll have considered.

We manage the Trust's mobile phone contract. According to our records, you are holding a Samsung Galaxy J4, mobile number 07841004702. This device is out of date and is like to get affected by the 3G switch Off happening this year thus an upgrade is required. To process your upgrade we will require your current handset to be returned to the Contact Centre (ATC Level 1) to be exchanged. We are available Monday-Friday between 08:30-16:30, please confirm your availability so we can arrange a suitable timeslot for you. Where we are able to, we will also transfer the data (contacts, photos, apps etc.) from your current phone to the new phone, however some out of date handsets do not allow for this so it may not be possible. To transfer data to your new phone we will require your handset to be left with us for approximately two hours, although time will vary dependant on the size of the data being transferred. If you would prefer not to transfer data from your current handset, we can provide your new phone 'out of the box', which takes approximately 20 minutes. Your mobile number will remain the same.                                                                                   If you are no longer holding 07841004702, or it is no longer required, please confirm as soon as possible. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions. Thank you  Kind regards, Joey Joey Perez | Administrator / Procurement Support Officer,Unified Communications Administration Team Tel: 01223 216170 option 1 | www.cuh.nhs.ukCapital, Estates &amp; Facilities Management | Box 144Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's HospitalCambridge Biomedical Campus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQ The Trust is: part of the National Institute for Health Research - Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and a member of Cambridge University Health Partners This email is confidential, see www.cuh.nhs.uk/email_disclaimer.html "^"From: 18558 - 05/14/2025 10:52:13 : Password: mowleme"^"From: 18558 - 05/14/2025 15:59:49 : complete  - collected by Liz"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I’ll close this ticket down but if this crops up again feel free to raise it again and we will look into it.Kind Regards,Zac"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I can reset the pin for you if needed.To record a personal greeting you will need to dial into the voicemail, via 21600 then when prompted dialling the voicemail ID (349294) and then the PIN. When you are in the voicemail you will go through the options and it is Option 5 to record a personal greeting. You will then be talked through how to record and save this.

The flaw is within ASP.Net Web Forms which use ViewState to preserve page and control state, with data encoded using Base64 protected by machine keys. An attacker with privileged system access may be able to obtain the machine keys, allowing them to create and send a malicious ViewState to the website, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the server. The ScreenConnect update disables ViewState and removes any dependency on it. Potential exploitation of flaw in ASP.NET Web Forms ViewStateMicrosoft have reported limited exploitation of a similar flaw within their security blog 'Code injection attacks using publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys'. While ConnectWise has not reported exploitation of ScreenConnect instances through this flaw, Microsoft have observed attackers with access to machine keys performing ViewState code injection attacks against other, undisclosed, technologies in the wild. Affected platforms:Connectwise ScreenConnectAffected organisations are encouraged to review ConnectWise advisory screenconnect-security-patch-2025.4 and apply the relevant updates as soon as practicable. Critical Zero-Day Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver CC-4649 Severity: Medium Published: 28/04/2025SAP has released an out-of-band security update to address a critical zero-day vulnerability in NetWeaver Visual Composer. SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer is a web-based software modelling tool. CVE-2025-31324 has a CVSSv3 score of 10.0 and if exploited could allow an unauthenticated attacker to upload files. An attacker could upload malicious executable files, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE). Exploitation of CVE-2025-31324Multiple sources are reporting active exploitation of CVE-2025-31324 in the wild. The NHS England National Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) assesses further exploitation as highly likely. Affected platforms:SAP NetWeaver Visual ComposerAffected organisations are encouraged to review the SAP Security Note 3594142 and apply the relevant updates as soon as practicable.Updates to previous cyber alerts:CC-4521: Proof-of-concept exploit code released for CVE-2024-6235 CC-4647: CVE-2025-34028 added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogue CC-4645: Added details for 'AirBorne' vulnerability chain, Added macOS Sonoma and macOS Ventura to Affected PlatformsCyber Associates Network TI SpaceNHS England has a dedicated ‘Threat Intelligence’ (TI) space on the FutureNHS Cyber Associates Network. To get access to the Cyber Associates Network: https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-and-data-security/about-us/cyber-associates-network Suppliers may also be endorsed to exclusively access the TI space by emailing: cybersecurity@nhs.net After an account has been created with FutureNHS, Cyber Associates Network should be selected on the ‘My Workspaces’ menu item.

CTI ensures decision makers are kept informed of the latest threats and that network defenders are empowered to detect and respond to events as they occur. Without a view of the cyber threat landscape organisations run the risk of defending against too little, or trying to constantly defend against too much without a view of which are the most relevant threats. Our CTI services use NHS England National CSOC’s advanced healthcare telemetry, which processes over 33 billion security signals daily, as well as integrating centrally procured threat intelligence from suppliers like CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence, Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence, Health-ISAC, and many more. This extensive intelligence is distributed into both national and local security systems, and now also offered directly to network defenders across the health and social care estate. Find out more on our service page: https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-and-data-security/incidents-and-alerts/cyber-threat-intelligence If you have access to the ‘Respond to an NHS Cyber Alert’ service, you can now opt-in to receive high severity alerts by SMS.

The flaw is within ASP.Net Web Forms which use ViewState to preserve page and control state, with data encoded using Base64 protected by machine keys. An attacker with privileged system access may be able to obtain the machine keys, allowing them to create and send a malicious ViewState to the website, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the server. The ScreenConnect update disables ViewState and removes any dependency on it. Potential exploitation of flaw in ASP.NET Web Forms ViewStateMicrosoft have reported limited exploitation of a similar flaw within their security blog 'Code injection attacks using publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys'. While ConnectWise has not reported exploitation of ScreenConnect instances through this flaw, Microsoft have observed attackers with access to machine keys performing ViewState code injection attacks against other, undisclosed, technologies in the wild. Affected platforms:Connectwise ScreenConnectAffected organisations are encouraged to review ConnectWise advisory screenconnect-security-patch-2025.4 and apply the relevant updates as soon as practicable. Critical Zero-Day Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver CC-4649 Severity: Medium Published: 28/04/2025SAP has released an out-of-band security update to address a critical zero-day vulnerability in NetWeaver Visual Composer.

CTI ensures decision makers are kept informed of the latest threats and that network defenders are empowered to detect and respond to events as they occur. Without a view of the cyber threat landscape organisations run the risk of defending against too little, or trying to constantly defend against too much without a view of which are the most relevant threats. Our CTI services use NHS England National CSOC’s advanced healthcare telemetry, which processes over 33 billion security signals daily, as well as integrating centrally procured threat intelligence from suppliers like CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence, Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence, Health-ISAC, and many more. This extensive intelligence is distributed into both national and local security systems, and now also offered directly to network defenders across the health and social care estate. Find out more on our service page: https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-and-data-security/incidents-and-alerts/cyber-threat-intelligence If you have access to the ‘Respond to an NHS Cyber Alert’ service, you can now opt-in to receive high severity alerts by SMS. Find out how to opt-in on our service page. If you or your IT provider require any additional support in implementing the recommended actions, please let us know via a new email to: cybersecurity@nhs.net. Do not reply directly to this bulletin email; responses are not monitored. For further information about Cyber Operation services, including previous advisories and guidance in cyber security matters, please visit our support page. When you use the NHS England website and sign up for security threat bulletins and emergency notifications, you agree to voluntarily submit information that enables us to contact you quickly and minimise the impact of any imminent threats. Whilst maintaining the contact list we have incorporated security that is up to date with latest industry standards. It is constantly reviewed and kept up to date. Your contact details are only accessible by you and those who we consider are authorised to access it including, for example, enquiries from within the same organisation. You can now manage your security contact details directly.

If the asset remains attached, it prevents us from selecting a contract. As a result, we are unable to build a proper history of remedial tasks against each asset.  Issue 2 When a remedial task is created, we currently have to delete all the location information that’s automatically pulled through from the PPM, enter a ‘Reporter,’ and then manually re-enter the same location details we had just removed. It would be helpful to have a default option, such as ‘Raised by Maintenance’, similar to existing processes in MRI, like when adding the event ‘PPM – Data Manager Review.’ Kind Regards Dwayne Dwayne Wright | CAFM Development and Systems Manager | Estates &amp; FacilitiesDirect Dial: 01223 254542Building, Engineering and Maintenance | Level 1Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's HospitalHills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQ | Box 102This email is confidential, see www.cuh.org.uk/email_disclaimer.html "^"From: 16244 - 05/21/2025 15:44:27 : will prioritise this first thing tomorrow"^"From: 16244 - 05/22/2025 15:18:27 : checked on it a - email sam for advise"^"From: 16244 - 05/27/2025 09:21:21 : Issue 1 The reason he cannot assign the task is that the asset's tag does not belong to the contract to which he is trying to assign it. To remedy this, we need to add and maintain all asset tags to every reactive contract. This is a straightforward task. Simply open the contract, navigate to the ""TAG"" section on the left-hand side, and use the ""Add All"" arrow. However, maintaining these tags can become problematic if not properly managed. While it is possible to manage this manually, I recommend using MRI to create a workflow that automatically adds any new asset tasks to all reactive contracts. When raising a remedial task after a PPM has been completed, the asset must be removed from the asset code in order to save the task. If the asset remains attached, it prevents us from selecting a contract. As a result, we are unable to build a proper history of remedial tasks against each asset.  Issue 2 The short answer is no, this isn't possible without limitions. The longer explanation is as follows: Once you select a building, you cannot then choose a reporter. Yes, it may seem confusing, but this is simply how Concept operates. Changing this would require a software modification and approval from MRI to implement it for every client. The reason a reporter must be added is that it is a compulsory field. If we were to disable this requirement, it would allow users to create follow-on tasks without needing to assign a reporter. Unfortunately, the downside of this change would be that it would enable users to raise any task without a reporter, including those created by the SSP. Therefore, I would not recommend pursuing this option. When a remedial task is created, we currently have to delete all the location information that’s automatically pulled through from the PPM, enter a ‘Reporter,’ and then manually re-enter the same location details we had just removed."^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to remove the divert you can do this by dialling ##9.The second and more flexible option is that we can se you up with our one number service.One Number Service allows you to make and receive calls using your work landline number from any location. When someone calls your work number, the service routes the call to your designated device (e.g., home phone, mobile, another trust landline). When you make a call using the service, your work landline number will be displayed as the caller ID.If you like I can set you up on One Number Service please just let me know, it will mean you get a new number.Kind Regards,Zac"^"From: 21843 - 05/20/2025 14:54:23 :  Hi Zac, &nbsp; Thanks for getting back to me promptly. &nbsp; The ‘One Number Service’ sounds like an ideal solution.

However with the aforementioned in mind, I am hopeful that you/your team may have some of these wide screen type monitors in storage that we could utilise without cost to the Trust, and look forward to your advice. Kind regards, Paul Bishop | Head of Fire Safety | MIFireE PgCert (Health) MIFSMTel: 01223 349511 | Mob: 07563374667 | www.cuh.org.uk Capital, Estates &amp; Facilities Management | Box 102Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Cambridge Biomedical Campus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQ The Trust is: part of the National Institute for Health Research - Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and a member of Cambridge University Health Partners Fire Safety Page: https://www.cuhconnect.nhs.uk/our-structure/a-z-teams/cefm/fire-safety-team/ This email is confidential, see www.cuh.org.uk/email_disclaimer.html   "^"From: 16244 - 05/21/2025 14:57:14 : From: PUSPUS, Armil (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;armil.puspus1@nhs.net&gt; Sent: 21 May 2025 14:54To: BISHOP, Paul (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;paul.bishop9@nhs.net&gt;Subject: Widescreen Monitors for Fire Team Hi Paul, How are you?

As I explained and demonstrated to you, the following reasons for asking for larger 32” 4K displays in the fire office are as follows; We need to review plans floor by floor, for example the new Cancer and Children’s Hospitals, and we need to be able to review the plans in as much detail as possible whilst looking at the largest possible area at any one time.  Details we check are AFD, damper and ventilation schematics, compartmentation plans, signage, distances etc. Being able to look at a larger detailed area allows us to check areas that affect each other and enable us to get a better holistic view of the fire strategy design to ensure that mistakes or designs from the architects and fire engineers are checked, corrected and within the HTM requirements. I hope this all makes sense.

I have checked the config of both phones against other opti’s and they all seem the same so I have rebooted the phones and done a little bit of testing and can’t re-create the issue. I’ll close this for now, but it would be worth testing next week when you are on opti if you get chance.Kind Regards,Zac"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most PCs within the CPDT team have either AutoCAD or SmallWorks database so before the PCs are replaced, we need to ensure the correct software is installed to avoid service disruption. I am unsure if TT have considered this. Our other concern is that the four PCs identified as the warranty expired in October 2024 and cannot take the Windows 10 upgrade have been told that their PCs are not being replaced. Whilst it is good that PCs within the wider team are being replaced, we feel that the priority should be for these four PCs previously identified be replaced in the first instance before we look at replacing other PCs. Armil and Darren have the details for the PCs that have been identified on a shared spreadsheet we hold. Is there some way we can liaise with TT to have an agreed approach on this please? Kind regards, Jo.Jo Robinson | Capital Admin ManagerCapital Planning and Development Team                                                         Tel: 01223 217868 | www.cuh.org.ukCapital, Estates &amp; Facilities Management | Box 102Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's HospitalCambridge Biomedical Campus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQThe Trust is: part of the National Institute for Health Research - Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and a member of Cambridge University Health PartnersThis email is confidential, see www.cuh.org.uk/email_disclaimer.html "^"From: 16244 - 05/23/2025 11:58:34 : From: HUDSON, Thomas (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;thomas.hudson@nhs.net&gt; Sent: 23 May 2025 11:48To: ROMBANO, Joanna (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;joanna.rombano@nhs.net&gt;Cc: LOOPER, Justin (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;justin.looper1@nhs.net&gt;; ANGELINI, Tana (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;tana.angelini1@nhs.net&gt;; ROBINSON, Jo (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;jo.robinson23@nhs.net&gt;; BALDWIN, Darren (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;darren.baldwin3@nhs.net&gt;; PUSPUS, Armil (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;armil.puspus1@nhs.net&gt;Subject: Re: CPDT PC Replacements I wasn't aware, I have emailed Paul Froud to see what is going on. Tom Hudson | Deputy Operations Manager | Estates Business ServicesDirect Dial : 01223 808301 | www.cuh.org.uk Unified Communications | Estates &amp; Facilities | Box 144Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Addenbrooke's HospitalCambridge Biomedical Campus | Hills Road | Cambridge | CB2 0QQ The Trust is: part of the National Institute for Health Research - Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre | and a member of Cambridge University Health PartnersThis email is confidential, see www.cuh.org.uk/email_disclaimer.htmlFrom: ROMBANO, Joanna (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;joanna.rombano@nhs.net&gt;Sent: 23 May 2025 10:20To: HUDSON, Thomas (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;thomas.hudson@nhs.net&gt;Cc: LOOPER, Justin (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;justin.looper1@nhs.net&gt;; ANGELINI, Tana (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;tana.angelini1@nhs.net&gt;; ROBINSON, Jo (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;jo.robinson23@nhs.net&gt;; BALDWIN, Darren (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;darren.baldwin3@nhs.net&gt;; PUSPUS, Armil (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) &lt;armil.puspus1@nhs.net&gt;Subject: Fw: CPDT PC Replacements Hi Tom, Just curious if you're in the loop with these PC replacements in Capital?  It doesn't sound like anyone in Capital was communicated to about the upcoming replacements. I've enquired to Kris from eHospital, and apparently he's also not looped in with the PC replacements, they are managed by TT directly.

CVE-2025-4919 could allow an attacker to perform an out-of-bounds read or write on a JavaScript object by confusing array index sizes.  Out-of-bounds access exploits against Firefox and Firefox ESR The NHS England National CSOC assesses that the vulnerabilities identified as CVE-2025-4918 and CVE-2025-4919 were exploited by security researchers during the Pwn2Own security hacking competition. Affected platforms:Firefox Firefox ESR Affected organisations are encouraged to review the Mozilla Foundation Security Advisories and apply the relevant updates as soon as practicable. These advisories are detailed below for clarity. Firefox | 138.0.4 Firefox ESR | 115.23.1 Firefox ESR | 128.10.1 Proof-of-Concept Released Oracle VM VirtualBox CC-4658 Severity: Medium Published:16/05/2025 Oracle has released a security update to address a critical vulnerability in Oracle VM VirtualBox. Oracle VM VirtualBox is cross-platform virtualisation software. CVE-2025-30712 could allow an attacker with administrative privileges to gain linear memory access, leading to arbitrary read/write access in the host memory, enabling virtual machine escape. The attacker could gain unauthorised access to all Oracle VM VirtualBox accessible data or critical data and that could lead to a partial denial-of-service (DoS) attack.  Note: Oracle has advised that CVE-2025-30712 may significantly impact other Oracle VM products. Proof-of-Concept released for CVE-2025-30712A public proof-of-concept exploit is available CVE-2025-30712. The NHS England National CSOC assesses exploitation of this vulnerability as more likely. Affected platforms:Firefox Affected organisations are encouraged to review Oracle's Critical Patch Update and apply the relevant updates as soon as practicable.NHS England Cyber Threat Intelligence ServicesNHS England provides a variety of central threat intelligence services for health and social care organisations. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) plays a critical role in defending organisations across the health and social care system against cyber threats. CTI ensures decision makers are kept informed of the latest threats and that network defenders are empowered to detect and respond to events as they occur. Without a view of the cyber threat landscape organisations run the risk of defending against too little, or trying to constantly defend against too much without a view of which are the most relevant threats. Our CTI services use NHS England National CSOC’s advanced healthcare telemetry, which processes over 33 billion security signals daily, as well as integrating centrally procured threat intelligence from suppliers like CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence, Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence, Health-ISAC, and many more. This extensive intelligence is distributed into both national and local security systems, and now also offered directly to network defenders across the health and social care estate. Find out more on our service page: https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-and-data-security/incidents-and-alerts/cyber-threat-intelligence If you have access to the ‘Respond to an NHS Cyber Alert’ service, you can now opt-in to receive high severity alerts by SMS. Find out how to opt-in on our service page. If you or your IT provider require any additional support in implementing the recommended actions, please let us know via a new email to: cybersecurity@nhs.net. Do not reply directly to this bulletin email; responses are not monitored. For further information about Cyber Operation services, including previous advisories and guidance in cyber security matters, please visit our support page. When you use the NHS England website and sign up for security threat bulletins and emergency notifications, you agree to voluntarily submit information that enables us to contact you quickly and minimise the impact of any imminent threats. Whilst maintaining the contact list we have incorporated security that is up to date with latest industry standards. It is constantly reviewed and kept up to date.

All MNO’s have confirmed to HMG this will be completed by end of 20332G is far more problematic especially in rural areas.Going forward I expect to see more issues with variable voice quality from mobiles especially 02.HMG have yet to say how they intend to fund unprofitable 4G/5G rollout to rural areas. HMG will be investing heavily in the rollout of 6G and this is expected to be commercial available in densely populated areas first around 2030.So Birmingham London Manchester Cardiff Edinburgh/Glasgow most likely first.These dates are based on current testing and may change.Charles "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Essentially when I start on a telephone call everything is fine, but over time, usually 10-15 mins or so, the call quality deteriorates and can become impossible. It seems to only be an issue with what I can hear, there seems to be no problem with my microphone.  I resolve the problem by hanging up and redialling but the problem recurs on the new call. I cannot reliably say whether this happens only on mobile calls because no one seems to have a landline any more so I have not been able to test with a landline. I rarely use the telephone for internal calls so have not experienced it on an internal call. Telephone number 348220. Found in the FTSU office.

If we were to block these numbers and then it was used to make a legitimate or emergency call to the hospital and not get through, it would cause a lot of problems.Usually, these calls will stop after being unsuccessful a few times. But please let us know if you have any more occurrences, so we can look at the call logs.Kind regards, Unified Communications, Infrastructure"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
